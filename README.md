## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Lessons Learned:
I learned more about making better utilization of my functions and was able to get more familiar with using arrays in javascript. I really pushed myself with this project to try to write cleaner code in my js, and it worked out, because I am able to look back at the code to gain more of an understanding.
